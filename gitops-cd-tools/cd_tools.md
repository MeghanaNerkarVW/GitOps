GitOps is a paradigm that helps automate application deployment and infrastructure provisioning. It typically involves using Git, an open source version control system, as a single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications. GitOps tools can provide additional benefits, which otherwise might require heavy customization of existing tools.

GitOps tools can help you with Continuous delivery for Kubernetes.
